# ProBuilder Instantiate Example Scene

Due to the UnityPackage build process, the prefab used in this
scene loses it's script references.  To fix this, drag the 
pb_Object script (found in ProBuilder->Classes->ProBuilderCore)
onto the first missing script well, and pb_Entity onto the
second missing script well.
